🛠️ DAS Form – Product Inquiry Button for Shopware 6
This Shopware 6 plugin adds a “Product Inquiry” button beneath the Add to Cart button on the product detail page.

When clicked, it opens a modal window containing a contact form that allows customers to ask questions about the product.
The subject and message fields in the form are automatically pre-filled with the product name to save your customers time and encourage interaction.

💡 Why this plugin?
This feature was widely loved in Shopware 5 – and now it’s making a comeback in Shopware 6.
It’s a great starting point for anyone who wants to restore this helpful customer interaction feature – and it’s 100% free.

⚠️ Note
This is an early version and may not be perfect yet – but it’s a solid foundation to build on. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
